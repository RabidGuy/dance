As the program executes, it will step through a series of phases. These
are:

  1. Pre-processing
  2. Proceessing
  3. Randomization
  4. Post-processing


1. Pre-processing
-----------------

Input: path to *.init file
Output: list of line objects representing input file with expanded references


2. Proceessing
--------------

Input: list of line objects
Output: list of actor objects


3. Randomization
----------------

Input: list of actor objects
Output: list of actor objects with individual initiative results


4. Post-processing
------------------

Input: list of actor objects with individual initiative results
Output: results which have been sorted, grouped, and pretty-printed
