File Contents
=============

Files consist of four elements: definitions, groups, inserts, and comments.
You may have one element per line in the file. Blank lines are allowed and
lines may have leading or trailing whitespace, which allows for indentation.


Elements
--------

Definition Syntax

	<nameword> [[nameword] ...]: <modint> [[keyword] ...]

	Each defintion must be placed on their own line. They are constructed of one
	or more name words, a colon, exactly one integer, and zero or one keyword.

	Example:

		Quomop Gadsbe: 3 adv


Names

	<nameword> [[nameword] ...]

	Names are made of one or more strings.


Initiative Bonuses

	<modint>


Keywords

	adv - roll twice, take higher
	disadv - roll twice, take lower
	force - return modint as result instead of rolling


Groups

	@<group_name>
	[definition]
	...

	Group names define grouping for conflict resolution. Actors from the same
	group that get the same initiative value are grouped together, sharing one
	initiative row in the program's output. If multiple such groups share the
	same initiative value, the order is shuffled without modifying any of the
	groups. All actors sharing a single initiative value still fall between
	actors with higher and lower values than their own.


Including Content from Other Files

	insert <relativepath>

	Examples:
		insert ../monsters/grey dwarves
		insert ../monsters/grey dwarves.init


Comments

	#[any number of words or characters before EOL]

	Comments must be placed on their own line and are ignored by the program.
	They can be used to add descriptions within the file as well as to toggle off
	lines without deleting them.
